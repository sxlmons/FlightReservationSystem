## Introduction
The Airline Flight Reservation System is a C-based program designed to simulate an airline reservation system. Users can:
- Reserve seats
- View available seats
- Sort seat arrangements
- Manage data

The design ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## System Design
The program is built on a modular design approach with the following key components:
1. **Main Module**: Coordinates the execution of all modules.
2. **Interface Module**: Handles user interactions.
3. **Data Module**: Manages the storage and retrieval of data.
4. **Seats Module**: Handles seat management, including availability and reservation.
5. **Sort Module**: Provides sorting functionalities for seat arrangements.
6. **Creators Module**: Handles program metadata (e.g., about the authors).

## Modules and Responsibilities

### 1. `main.c`
- Serves as the entry point of the program.
- Calls relevant functions based on user input.

### 2. `interface.c`
- Displays menus and collects user input.
- Validates user actions.

### 3. `data.c`
- Reads and writes data to/from files.
- Ensures data persistence.

### 4. `seats.c`
- Manages seat allocation and availability.
- Tracks reservation statuses.

### 5. `sort.c`
- Implements sorting algorithms for displaying seat arrangements.
- Sorts by user-defined criteria (e.g., seat number, availability).

### 6. `creators.c`
- Provides program credits and developer information.

## Data Flow
1. **User Input**: Input is collected through the `interface` module.
2. **Processing**: The appropriate logic is executed by the relevant module (`seats`, `sort`, or `data`).
3. **Data Persistence**: The `data` module ensures all changes are stored persistently.
4. **Output**: Results are displayed to the user via the `interface`.

---

## Error Handling
- Invalid user inputs are validated and prompt error messages are displayed.
- File I/O operations handle scenarios like missing or corrupted files.
- Memory allocation is checked to prevent crashes.

## Future Enhancements
1. **GUI Integration**: Develop a graphical interface for better usability.
2. **Dynamic Data**: Allow real-time updates for flights and reservations.
3. **Multi-User System**: Support concurrent access by multiple users.
4. **Database Integration**: Transition from file-based storage to a database for better scalability.
